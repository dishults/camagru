# camagru
#### A web application allowing you to make basic photo and video editing using your webcam and some predefined images

To launch the project execute
```shell
docker compose up
#OR
docker-compose up
```

Or without docker
```shell
python mysite/manage.py runserver --insecure
```
> `--insecure` is needed so that Django's built-in server will continue serving static files if DEBUG is set to False in settings.py. If you set DEBUG to True you can remove it.
